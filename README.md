## More Life - Currently broken
Increased (or decreased) spawn rates for peds, animals, and wagons. 
## Postal Delivery
Players can move mail from a post office to another post office.
## Stagecoach Transporting
Players can take a stagecoach company stagecoach and drive around county at pre-destined locations. People can ride along and will pay a small fee to the driver. If no other people ride in the wagon, then pay full amount for transporting the wagon itself.

## Hitman contracts
Players can meet a High Society member in Saint Denis that will send letters, and assign hits to local npcs.

## Stagecoach Robberies
Players can rob stagecoaches across the county, if they find certain loot, the payout would be great. Difficult and lots of hordes of enemies.

## Automatic Updating
Follow the steps in #Installation
